## Introduction

WDSS's Beginner's Python course is designed for anyone completely new to Python or even programming in general. The course is self-contained and approaches the language in a slow and friendly manner, assuming no prior knowledge. All of our resources are free to be used by anyone, though WDSS do offer teaching and mentorship for this course to make learning even easier. Keep an eye on our [socials](#socials) to be the first to know when we begin a new iteration.

Have fun learning!

## Getting Started

### Using Google Colab (Recommended)

To make learing Python as simple as possible, we have centred our course around the use of Google Colab, a free, interactive cloud environment for Python programming. You can get setup with Colab by visiting [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/) or searching for Google Colab (using Google Chrome, as this has the best compatibility, unsurprisingly). Sign up using a Google account and get started by going to `File > New Python Notebook`. 

All of our exercise and solution sheets also have links to open them in Colab. Once you are finished with your work, save these to your own drive using `File > Save a Copy in Drive`.

### Using Anaconda Locally (Optional)

If you wish to avoid using Google Colab or want to code without an internet connection, you can setup up Anaconda on your computer to obtain a similiar, but local, experience. You can do this by visting [this link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and following installation instructions. Once you have Anaconda installed, open the Anaconda Navigator (this is just a normal program you'll find in your start menu). Then, launch 'Jupyter Notebook' and click `New > Python 3 Notebook`. This will create a blank Python 3 notebook just like with Colab. You can still use our templates by downloading the raw file from GitHub, placing it in your documents, and navigating to it in Jupyter.

## Using This Repository

Each session is contained in its own folder and includes the Powerpoint presentation given in the session, an answer template for the session exercises, a homework sheet to practice your skills, as well as corresponding solutions. All exercise and solutions notebooks will contain a link at the top of the page to open the document in Google Colab

## Quick Access to Resources

Our material is all ready to go and we will add links for each session at the beginning of the week.

## Session Summaries

### Session 1

* Get set up on Google Colab
* Let Python 'talk' to you using the `print()` function
* Use Python as a basic calculator
* Give Python 'memory' using variables

### Session 2

* 'Talk' back to Python using the `input()` function
* Learn why variable types are important
* Use lists to store multiple numbers
* Compute attributes of lists such as total, length, minimum and maximum

### Session 3

* Learn how to compare two difference numbers with comparison operators
* Combine conditions using Boolean operators
* Add logic to your code using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
* Use `while` loops to repeatedly run blocks of code

### Session 4

* Recap the use of lists in Python and use them to store more than just numbers
* Learn how to access individual items of lists as well as extract sub-lists
* Manipulate lists, adding, removing, and altering elements
* Understand the difference and similarities between tuples and lists

### Session 5

* Learn how to use `for` loops to run code a predetermined number of times
* Loop through lists and ranges of numbers
* Escape loops using `break` and `continue`
* Learn how to enumerate loops

### Session 6

* Create functions to modularise your code
* Add function parameters
* Apply recursive strategies to solve common problems
* Understand the nature of variable scope

### Session 7

* Learn the limitations of lists/tuples
* Use dictionaries to overcome these
* Manipulate dictionaries, as with lists
* Loop through dictionaries in multiple ways

### Session 8

* Read from a text file
* Write text to a file
* Learn how to raise errors
* Use common built-in packages in your code

## Additional Content

In Python, there is often more than one way to do things. A particular style, known as Pythonic programming, is often favoured for its elegance and efficiency. On top of the base content, you are encouraged to have a look at the topics below which introduce some extra knowlege and techniques you can apply in your code.

### Session 1

The extra [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/warwickdatascience/beginners-python/blob/master/session_one/session_one_additional_content.ipynb) for session one covers:
* `sep`, `end`, special characters for printing
* `__repr__` vs `__str__`
* Modular arithmetic
* Math
* Inplace operators
* Multiple assignment (AKA tuple unpacking)

## Getting Help

If you are taking this course through WDSS, your first port of call for any issues is your mentor. They will be able to handle the majority of issues and can elevate any particulary troublesome or important ones.
