## Introduction

## Getting Started

## Using This Repository

Each session is contained in its own folder and includes the Powerpoint presentation given in the session, an answer template for the session exercises, a selection of bonus exercises to hone your skills, as well as corresponding solutions. All exercise and solutions notebooks will contain a link at the top of the page to open the document in Google Colab

The project solution is intended to be a model solution containing full documentation and testing. It is not expected for you to add such additional components to your solution but rather you should focus on the essential parts. A full solution is only provided as indication of the direction we want to be heading in and to build up experience with looking at source code.
