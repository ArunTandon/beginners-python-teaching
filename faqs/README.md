# Beginner's Python: Frequently-Asked Questions

## What is the expected workload?
Commitment: 8 weeks (in total 32 hours of expected work)
 - Weekly teaching session (1 hour per week)
 - Weekly homework sheet (1 hour per week)
 - Self-study, practice and extra example-sheets (2 hours per week)
 
This is a student-led initiative, not certified by the University of Warwick. However, the expected amount of workload is approximately the same as for a module worth 4 CATS.

## How to receive the certificate?
If you are taking this course through WDSS and want to receive the certificate, you should  submit all  the notebooks  with solutions of  the homework exercises  to  your mentor by the specified deadline. They will assess your progress and based on that you will be issued the certificate. Only the general homework exercises are taken into consideration.It is therefore important to **save all your homework notebooks** as evidence of completing the course. **Note**: the solutions to the homework exercises are also available on the course website but you are encouraged not to look into those and tackle the questions by yourself. For the course run in Term 2 2021 the deadline for submitting your work is the **first day of Term 3 - Monday 26 April 2021**

If you are taking this course independently but still wish to receive the certificate, reach out to [Kasia Kobalczyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarzyna-kobalczyk/) (course director)

## I take the course through WDSS. When and how should I submit the homework?
The homework notebooks should be submitted directly to your mentor. You can submit all your notebooks in one batch at the end of the course or send them to your mentor regularly as the course progresses. What matters is that your mentor receives your work before the deadline. The way of how you can send the notebooks should be agreed on between you end your mentor (for example through email or Teams).


## I take the course through WDSS. Do I need to attend the live teaching events? 
Live teaching events are not compulsory. If you are not able or opt not to attend our live teaching events, then you may follow the course content at your own pace - all of the recordings and materials are available through the website. However, we strongly recommend that you attend the live events as it gives you the chance to clarify any doubts as soon as they arise and they keep you engaged with the course.
