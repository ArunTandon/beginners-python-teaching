    "The field of game theory in  economics is concerened with the study of strategic interactions - situations where an agent's payoff depends not only on their actions, but also on the actions of others. The base concept in game theory is that of Nash equilibria - game outcomes that can be considered 'self-enforcing' since all players end up playing their best move given the others' moves. Finding Nash equilibria can be time-consuming to do by hand, so we will use Python to help us find solve some simple two-player games!"
